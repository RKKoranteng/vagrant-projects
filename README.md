* [MySQL](mysql)

## Cheatsheet
Here's a guide to create a VM using Vagrant base image
```
# Create a directory to keep all vagrant related files for the VM
$ mkdir backstage
$ cd backstage

# Initialize the Vagrant configuration file </br>
$ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

# Start the VM
$ vagrant up
```

You can use Vagrant to manage the running virtual machine. To view all Vagrant commands, just type `vagrant` on your terminal.

* **vagrant up:** Launches the virtual machine and provisions it according to the settings in the Vagrantfile. This command will simply connect to the virtual machine if it is already running.

* **vagrant halt:** Stops the virtual machine by delivering a shutdown signal to the guest operating system. This command is similar to shutting down a real computer.

* **vagrant reload:** Restarts the virtual machine and re-provisions it depending on any changes in the Vagrantfile.

* **vagrant ssh:** Connects to the virtual machine via SSH. This command is useful for accessing the command line interface of the virtual machine.

* **vagrant status:** Shows the current status of the virtual machine, including whether it's running, stopped, or suspended.

* **vagrant destroy:** Deletes the virtual machine and all associated resources. This command is useful for cleaning up your development environment.
